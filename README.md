# MLM-Project-1-045029
Overview:

This project analyzes cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using machine learning on a comprehensive dataset. With CVDs posing a significant global health threat, this project aims to explore the relationship between various risk factors and the likelihood of developing CVDs.

Key Objectives:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand variable distribution and identify patterns.
Feature Selection: Identify relevant features for clustering.
Model Building: Apply k-means clustering to group individuals with similar characteristics.
Evaluation: Assess clustering quality using metrics like within-cluster sum of squares.
Interpretation: Interpret clustering results to understand demographic and risk profiles associated with CVDs.
Methodology:

The project preprocesses data, conducts EDA, and selects features for clustering. It then applies k-means clustering and evaluates clustering quality. Gaussian Mixture Models are explored to capture data's probabilistic structure. Visualizations aid in interpretation.

Conclusion:

This project enhances understanding of CVDs and aids in developing targeted interventions. Leveraging machine learning, it uncovers hidden patterns, improving risk assessment and healthcare outcomes. It highlights data-driven approaches' importance in healthcare analytics and machine learning's potential in addressing complex health challenges.
